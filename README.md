Final project of CS50 course.

## MUSIX MATCH
## Music Streaming Social Web Application


# Project Description

My project idea is to create a music streaming social web application. The main features of the application include:

- User Authentication: Users will be required to login using their Spotify account.
- Playlist Integration: All of the user's created playlists will be added to the application's database.
- Continuous Music Playback: Random songs from other users' playlists will be played continuously to the logged-in user.
- Like System: If the user likes a song, a like point will be given to the user whose playlist the song belongs to. The next song from the same user's playlist will be played until the user dislikes any song.
- Like-to-Dislike Ratio: The like-to-dislike ratio of the user's playlist songs will be displayed in the user's profile as a percentage.
- Leaderboard: There will be a leaderboard based on the user's percentage of likes.
- Daily Votes: There will be daily votes to determine whose playlist will be streamed in a room where anyone can join. The voting system will be based on a similar like-dislike concept mentioned above, but only for that single day.
- Two playlists will be selected for votes in the room to be played next while the playlist that previously won will be playing now.
